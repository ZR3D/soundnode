You can create individual or instrument sounds in the node editor and incorporate them into playable multi-track songs.

Songs and can be exported in .wav format and imported/exported in JSON format. All individual tracks can be exported separately to .wav

Sounds can be imported or exported in JSON to backup or share.

The data is stored in your browsers localstorage and all created sounds and songs can be exported to JSON for backup or to be imported to another computer

SoundNode is designed for laptop/desktop first.

The intent of the project is to make the creative use of the Web Audio API easy and intuitive by connecting nodes in a visual node editor.

The index.html file has no dependancies and is designed to work offline with users able to download and share this single file easily and use localy or off a USB without requiring a server.

The sound_node_player.html is not required and is only a code template so users can export individual sounds or songs in .json format and incorporate directly into their own project code e.g. a web based game or alarm for a timer.
